Then BOY DO WE HAVE THE THING FOR YOU!!!<br />
<br />
Introducing the FactSpammer2000!<br />
<br />
The FactSpammer2000 is a revolutionary program that allows you to post facts on<br />
your favorite servers and to your hearts content.<br />
<br />
How does it work!?<br />
<br />
I'm glad you asked!<br />
<br />
Using our super high-tech programming language, we have constructed the perfect<br />
mix of shitposting and information, providing useful facts while garenteed to<br />
annoy any well-meaning server admin.*<br />
<br />
When you start our FactSpammer2000, you are greeted by a list of pre-loaded<br />
facts specially loaded by our trained professionals.  You can add your own to the<br />
list by simply creating a text file with each fact on a new line!<br />
(the file name must also be in all lower-case)<br />
<br />
Have we sold you yet? OF COURSE WE HAVE!<br />
